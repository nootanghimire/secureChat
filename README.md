======

As in the description, I am trying to use nodejs and some ideas of 
Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange + Symmetric Key encryption to do something 
like Off-The-Record, anonymous, encrypted-by-client, 
undecryptable-by-server . 


This repo is too dirty for now. I wish to perform and commit changes 
over the span of a month from now. Sorry for those *~ temp files from 
emacs 
(too 
lazy to write .gitignore), 


Need To Implement
=====

In this current version, the prime number generator is nothing but a 
function that chooses a random array index and returns the value at that 
index. Since this was initally intended only for myself to know about 
how DH can be used in combination with Symmetric Key algorithm, I need 
to redo the whole function to implement that feature.  (Maybe I should 
list bugs rather than write further)

Really? It's under the public domain! Do whatever yuo want to do. I 
don't care. And don't guarantee anything.
